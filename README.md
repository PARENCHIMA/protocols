# Protocols

This repository holds a collection of renal MRI acquisition protocols that are compliant with the PARENCHIMA technical recommendations for clinical renal MRI put forward by Task force 1.2:

https://www.renalmri.org/taskforce/15

The recommendations will be published in the special issue on renal MRI in the journal MAGMA (publication date 1 january 2020).

The published papers will list the recommendations in vendor-neutral language, and will not define the sequences fully. This repository acts as supplementary material and will contained detailed protocols in vendor-specific format. The aim is to facilitate local implementations of sequences that are compliant with the general recommendations.

The list of protocols in this respository is dynamic and will be updated as and when the recommendations are revised. 

If you have protocols that are compliant with the recommendations and that you would like to share, please create a pull request. They will be revised by the chairs of the expert panels for compliance with the recommendations before merging with the master repository.
