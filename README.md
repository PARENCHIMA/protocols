# Purpose

This repository holds a collection of renal MRI acquisition protocols that are compliant with the PARENCHIMA technical recommendations for clinical renal MRI put forward by Task force 1.2:

https://www.renalmri.org/taskforce/15

The recommendations will be published in the special issue on renal MRI in the journal MAGMA (publication date 1 january 2020).

The published papers will list the recommendations in vendor-neutral language, and will not define the sequences fully. This repository acts as supplementary material and will contained detailed protocols in vendor-specific format. The aim is to facilitate local implementations of sequences that are compliant with the general recommendations.

The list of protocols in this respository is dynamic and will be updated as and when the recommendations are revised. 

# Contribute

If you have protocols that are compliant with the recommendations and that you would like to share, please contact Dr. Pim Pullens (Pim.Pullens@uzgent.be, University Hospital Ghent, Belgium). He will collate the data and forward to the expert panels who will check for compliance with the recommendations before merging with the master repository.

The following data and materials must be provided for each protocol:

1. An ordered list of protocol authors for credit
2. A reference to the paper (or study) where the protocol is applied
3. Scanner type, software version and coil info

For Siemens:

1. PDF output of the protocol (mandatory)
2. If possible, edx/exar1 files
3. At least one DICOM file for each protocol step if possible

For Philips:

1. Text output of each sequence in the protocol (mandatory)
2. ExamCard if possible
3. At least one DICOM file for each protocol step if possible

For GE:

1. PDF file of the protocol (mandatory)
2. At least one DICOM file of each sequence in the protocol (mandatory)
3. Protocol Exchange files if possible
(Note: We need DICOM and/or Protocol Exchange files, because the information in the PDF is limited)
